ABBREVIATIONS AND DEFINITIONS 26APPENDIX 1 \nv UK OFFSHORE PUBLIC TRANSPORT  HELICOPTER SAFETY RECORD\n(1976 \u2013 2002)\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThis report was commissioned by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) with the support of the Civil\nAviation Authority (CAA), to produce a safety record of UKCS offshore helicopter operations and to makecomparisons with various other modes of transport.\nUKCS offshore helicopter operations data covering 27 years (1976 to 2002) are available for analysis and\ncomparison, and have been grouped into three 9-year inclusive periods as follows: 1976 to 1984, 1985 to 1993, and 1994 to 2002. It should be noted, however, that the data sets used to obtain accident rates for offshore helicopter operations are relatively small, hence caution is required when interpreting the results.\nFrom 1976 up to year-end 2002, just over 48 million passengers were transported to and from offshore\ninstallations on the UKCS. Over 6 million sectors were flown taking about 2.7 million flying hours. During this \ntime 7 fatal accidents claimed the lives of 88 offshore workers and flight crew. As a measure of currentUKCS activity, some 160,000 sectors were flown in 2002 transporting over 1.5 million passengers offshore\nand sector flight times averaged just over 30 minutes.\nDuring the first 18 years (1976 to 1993) 6 fatal accidents were recorded (3 in each 9-year period of review).\nDuring the last 9 years 1994 to 2002 there was one fatal accident and this occurred in July 2002.Catastrophic component failure was the primary cause of 4 accidents and the other 3 were attributed to human factors.\n42 non-fatal reportable accidents were recorded during the first 18 years of UKCS offshore helicopter\noperations, 20 in the period 1976 to 1984 and 22 in the period 1985 to 1993. Between 1994 and 2002 there were 8 non-fatal reportable accidents and, taking into account the corresponding rates for the three periods(see Table 3.17), this represents a significant reduction on the previous two periods.\nData for World\u2013Wide and All North Sea offshore helicopter operations is available from the International Oil\n& Gas Producers Association (OGP), but is limited to the period 1995 - 2002. Table 1 overleaf compares the global fatal and non-fatal accident rates with UKCS helicopter operations during this period with both fataland non-fatal accident rates based on 100,000 flying hours \/ sectors (flight stages) flown. For the period1995 to 2002, the UKCS recorded one fatal accident whereas 3 fatal accidents were recorded for All North Sea operations and 40 Worldwide. The UKCS fatal accident rate (flying hours) compares favourably withthe figure for Worldwide operations and is lower than the rate for All North Sea. For the same period, non-fatal reportable accident rates for flying hours for the UKCS are lower than, but similar to All North Sea and Worldwide operations. The non-fatal reportable accident rates for sectors show the UKCS to be better thanAll North Sea and virtually the same as Worldwide operations.\nviREGION PERIODFATAL\nACCIDENT\nRATES\n(Flying Hrs.)NON-FATAL\nACCIDENT\nRATES\n(Flying Hrs.)FATAL\nACCIDENT\nRATES\n(Sectors)NON-FATAL\nACCIDENT\nRATES\n(Sectors)\nAll North Sea 1995 - 2002 0.23 1.32 Not available 0.95\nWorldwide 1995 - 2002 0.57 1.45 Not available 0.47\nUKCS 1995 - 2002 0.14 1.10 0.06 0.50\nTable 1   Comparison of UKCS Accident Rates with OGP Worldwide Average Fatal and \nReportable Accident Rates 1995 to 2002 \nComparing offshore helicopter operations with other forms of transport used in the UK (e.g. car, train, pedal\ncycle) provides a useful comparison wi th everyday experience. The late st available data from the DETR\n(1992 to 2001) indicates that the safety record of offshore helicopter travel compares favourably with other forms of commonly used land-based passenger transport apart from rail, and is very similar to travel by car.See Table 2 below.\nTRANSPORT MODE 1992 - 2001 AVERAGE\nOffshore Helicopter 4.33\nAir 0.01\nRail 0.4\nCar 3\nTwo Wheeled Motor Vehicle 106\nPedal Cycle 42\nPedestrian 58\nTable 2    Comparison of Average Passenger Fatality Rates per Billion Passenger Kilometres by \nTransport Mode 1992 to 200 1\nOverall it can be claimed that, in recent years, UKCS offshore helicopter operations have achieved a good \nsafety record. This is demonstrated by recording zero fatalities for the 9-year period from 1993 to 2001.However, the fatal S76 accident that occurred in 2002 clearly demonstrates there is no room for complacency. Additionally, non-fatal reportable accidents continue to occur on the UKCS with serious injuryoccasionally being inflicted. This situation highlights the need for the UK Oil & Gas industry to continue tovigorously pursue safety initiatives (current and future) and research projects to further reduce risks. Appendix 1 of this report describes safety enhancements that have been introduced to UKCS helicopteroperations resulting from several initiatives and research projects, and future enhancements that are expected to result from ongoing work.\nvii1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND\n1.1 INTRODUCTION\nThe HSE and the CAA are responsible for regulating UK offshore health and safety and aviation\nsafety respectively. The actual achievement of aviation safety is the responsibility of all those on whom the law places a duty of care and these include, but are not limited to, helicopter operators,flight crews, installation operators and offshore workers with helicopter \/ helideck duties.\nHelicopter transport is primarily the CAA\u2019s area of regulatory responsibility whereas Installations \nare the responsibility of HSE. However, in practice, both regulators share a common and practicalinterest for many aspects of offshore helicopter safety performance and are therefore jointlyseeking continuous improvement. HSE \/ CAA Leaflet IND (G) 219L sets out in more detail howoffshore helicopter travel is regulated and the responsibilities and arrangements in place to ensure the safety of offshore helicopter operations.\nThe HSE and CAA regularly consult on offshore helicopter safety and both regulators agree that\noffshore helicopter risk is a topic that needs continuous scrutiny. HSE and CAA are concerned,however, that the long held perception of the workforce that offshore helicopter operations are a \"high risk mode of transport\" does not match the statistical evidence .This apparent misconception\nled to the initiation of this project to gain a better insight into offshore helicopter risk, including\navailable safety performance data and the criteria used to measure it.\nThe purpose of this study is to provide an accurate historical safety record for UK offshore public\ntransport helicopters over the period 1976 to 2002, and to compare fatal and non-fatal accidentnumbers and rates with other UK and worldwide aviation data and other forms of transport.  It ishoped that this will provide a good foundation for risk assessments of UKCS helicopter activities,and give good indicators of the overall performance and potential risks.\n1.2 BACKGROUND \nOffshore public transport helicopter flight statistics and reportable accident data are available for a period covering the 27 years of UKCS operations from 1976 to 2002.\nFrom 1976 up to year-end 2002, more than 48.25 million passengers have been transported to \nand from offshore Installations on the UKCS. Over 6 million sectors were flown taking about 2.75 million flying hours. As a measure of current UK CS activity, some 160,000 sectors were flown in \n2002 transporting over 1.5 million passengers offshore, and sector flight times averaged just over 30 minutes.\n1Between 1976 and 2002 seven fatal accidents claimed the lives of 88 offshore workers and flight\ncrew whilst travelling in offshore helicopters. Catastrophic component failure was the primarycause of 4 accidents and the other 3 were attributed to human factors. There have also been two HLO fatalities on helidecks.  Occasionally, reportable (non-fatal) accidents have also occurred, just as they do in other aviation sectors. These have included lightning strikes, major airframedamage, loss of engine power, tail rotor damage and loss of flight control.  In most of these casesonly the helicopter has been damaged but, infrequently, these incidents have resulted in injury topersonnel.\nIn the last decade, a large number of safety enhancements have been introduced to UKCS \nhelicopter operations and they are described in Appendix 1 of this report. These enhancementshave resulted from a number of initiatives and research projects.\n22. DATA SOURCES AND ANALYSIS\n2.1 DATA SOURCES\nThe main data source and references used for developing the UK offshore helicopter safety\nrecord are: \n\/g183\/g32 CAA SS&A UK Offshore Helicopters Annual Flight Statistics for the Period 1976 \u2013 2002. \nThis data source includes flight hours, sectors flown, passengers carried, fatal and reportable\naccidents, crew and passenger fatalities, etc.\nLater in the report the following information sources have been referenced for comparative\npurposes:\n\/g183\/g32 International Association of Oil & Gas Producers (OGP) \u2013 Safety Performance of Helicopter Operations in the Oil & Gas industry 1995 to 2002.

In the analysis, rates for fatal and non-fatalreportable accidents have been confined only to those occurrences that relate specifically tohelicopters carrying the offshore oil & gas workforce as passengers (such offshore oil & gashelicopter operations are defined by the Air Navigation Order as being non-scheduled publictransport).\n3It is recommended that helideck crew fatalities and the non-fatal reportable accidents excluded in\nthis report should be included in risk assessments (e.g. QRA), if establishing \u201cIndividual Risk\u201d for activities relating to offshore Installations. Excluded offshore helicopter fatal accidents are listed inTables 2.1and 2.2 below.\nYEAR OCCURRENCE OUTCOME\n1981 Bell 212 (G-BDIL) crashed into the sea in poor \nvisibility during a mission to winch a casualty from aship.6 fatalities (all on board) \n1982 Bell 212 (G-BJJR) crashed into the sea on approach\nto an oil rig to embark passengers (positioning flight).2 Flight Crew fatalities\n1992 Helideck accident on MS Mayo.

UK OFFSHORE PUBLIC TRANSPORT HELICOPTER\nSAFETY RECORD \n3.1 INTRODUCTION\nThis section deals with helicopter types, historical flight statistics and fatal and non-fatal reportable\naccidents that have occurred during UKCS offshore helicopter passenger transport flights. All dataused in this section has been obtained from the CAA SS&A UK Offshore Helicopters Annual FlightStatistics for the Period 1976 \u2013 2002. \nWhere accident rates are shown in this section of the report, a base of 100,000 has been used for\nflying hours and sectors flown (flight stages). This is the figure generally used by the oil and gasindustry and the CAA. \n3.2 HELICOPTER TYPES\nDuring the period 1976 to 2002 the helicopter types engaged in offshore service on the UKCS are shown in Table 3.1 below.\nTYPE WEIGHT CLASS INTRODUCED WITHDRAWN\nBell 212 Medium Pre 1975 2000\nBell 214 ST Heavy 1982 Still in Service\nBoeing BV234 (Chinook) Extra Heavy 1980 1989\nEurocopter B105 Light 1977 2001\nEurocopter AS330 (Puma) Medium 1977 1985\nEurocopter AS332 (Super\nPuma)Heavy 1982 Still in Service\nEurocopter AS365 (Dauphin) Medium 1979 Still in Service\nSikorsky S58 Medium Pre 1975 1980\nSikorsky S61 Heavy Pre 1975 Still in Service\nSikorsky S76 Medium 1980 Still in Service\nWestland 30 Medium 1982 1991\nWestland Wessex 60 Medium 1975 1981\nTable 3.1    Helicopter Types Used in UKCS Offshore Support \nFrom this table it can be seen that most of the earlier helicopter types have been withdrawn from \nUKCS offshore flight operations and replaced by more modern aircraft.\n5It should also be noted that some of the helicopter types currently in North Sea service, namely\nthe AS332 (Super Puma), AS365 (Dauphin) and S76, have been significantly modified since theyfirst entered service. Later variants of the AS332, AS365 and S76 have modifications that introduced improved technologies and systems and, as a result, exhibit improved performanceand safety features.\nOffshore helicopter types are categorised into the following Maximum Take-off Weight Authorised\n(MTWA) groups.\nExtra Heavy Twin >20000 Kg MTWA (e.g. Chinook)\nHeavy Twin >5700 Kg MTWA (e.g. S61 and Super Puma) Medium Twin 2730 to 5700 Kg MTWA (e.g. Dauphin and S76) Light Twin < 2730 Kg MTWA (e.g. Bo 105) Since 2001, only Heavy and Medium Twin engine helicopters have been used on the UKCS. It is important here to make a distinction between Heavy and Medium Twin helicopter operations.\nAs a rule it can be said that Heavy Twins (e.g. S61, AS332 and Bell 214) operate mainly out of Aberdeen and generally fly sectors (flight stages) with long flight times. Medium Twins (e.g. S76and AS365) fly mainly out of regional heliports (e.g. Blackpool, North Denes, Norwich andHumberside) and these aircraft record a high number of sectors (flight stages) with relatively shortflight times.\n3.3 HISTORICAL ACCIDENTS AND FLIGHT STATISTICS\nThe pie charts in Figure 3.2 provide a breakdown of UKCS offshore helicopter operations flyinghours and sector (flight stage) activity by MTWA groups for the period 1976 to 2002.\nTable 3.3 summarises all the UKCS offshore public transport fatal accidents referenced in this\nreport.\n61,797,100\n(66%)729,396\n(27%)155,065\n(6%)35,338\n(1%)\nEXTRA HEAVY TWIN (>20000 Kg MTWA)\nHEAVY TWIN (>5700 Kg MTWA)\nMEDIUM TWIN (2730 - 5700 Kg MTWA)\nLIGHT TWIN (<2730 Kg MTWA)UKCS OFFSHORE HELICOPTER FLYING HOURS 1976 - 2002\n591,524\n(10%)\n3,212,751\n(53%)2,290,165\n(37%)25,219\n(<1%)\nEXTRA HEAVY TWIN (>20000 Kg MTWA)\nHEAVY TWIN (>5700 Kg MTWA)\nMEDIUM TWIN (2730 - 5700 Kg MTWA)\nLIGHT TWIN (<2730 Kg MTWA)UKCS OFFSHORE HELICOPTER SECTORS FLOWN (FLIGHT STAGES) 1976-2002\nFigure 3.2    UKCS Offshore Helicopter Flight Statistics (1976 \u2013 2002)\n7YEAR AIRCRAFT TYPE FATAL INJURED INCIDENT\nLOCATIONCAUSED BY PRIMARY CAUSE \n1976 Sikorsky S 58 ET 1 0 Forties Field Tail Rotor detached as A\/C approached to land on \nhelideck.

All offshore helicopter types that have been used on the UKCS are included and the rates are based on 100,000 flying hours and sectors (flight stages)flown.\nPer 100,000 Flying Hours Per 100,000 Sectors\n(Flight Stages) \nHELICOPTER MTWA GROUPOccupant Fatal \nAccident Rate Non-Fatal\nReportable\nAccident Rate Occupant Fatal \nAccident Rate Non-Fatal\nReportable\nAccident Rate \nExtra Heavy Twin(> 20000 Kg MTWA)127.34 5.66 178.44 7.93\nHeavy Twin\n(> 5700 Kg MTWA)0.95 1.89 0.74 1.48\nMedium Twin\n(<5700 Kg MTWA)3.29 1.51 0.75 0.34\nLight Twin\n(< 2730 Kg MTWA)0.00 1.93 0.00 0.51\nAll UK Offshore Helicopters 3.24 1.84 1.44 0.82\nAdjusted for Current Helicopter\nTypes in Use1.24 1.73 0.65 0.90\nTable 3.4    Fatal and Non-Fatal Reportable Accident Rates by Helicopter MTWA Groups\n1976 \u2013 2002 \nWith 45 fatalities, the Extra Heavy Twin (Chinook) accident in 1986 dominates the overall fatal\naccident rate statistics for both flying hours and sectors flown. Since 1989 this aircraft type has not flown offshore in the UK and it accounts for only a very small proportion (1%) of the total flyinghours between 1976 and 2002. \nBy comparison, other weight classes have better records particularly the Light Twins with no \nfatalities recorded. However, it should be borne in mind that Light Twins only account for a smallnumber (6%) of the total flying hours between 1976 and 2002.\nThe safety performance of Heavy and Medium Twins is similar in terms of the fatal accident rate \nfor sectors flown (flight stages). This performance contrasts with fatal accident rate for flying hourswhere Medium Twins are just under three and a half times higher than Heavy Twins. The higherratio of sectors to flying hours of almost 3.5:1 accumulated by Medium Twins would appear to \n9account for this significant difference and suggests that accidents are more closely correlated to \nsectors than flying hours.\nWhen comparing non-fatal accident rates for sectors flown (flight stages) by weight class, Medium\nand Light Twins have a better record than Heavy Twins.\n3.5 UK OFFSHORE HELICOPTER SAFETY RECORD \n3.5.1 Introduction \nThis section analyses the UKCS Offshore Safety Record for the 27 years of UK offshorehelicopter operations from 1976 to 2002 inclusive.\nFor comparative purposes the data have been broken down into the three 9-year periods of 1976 \nto 1984, 1985 to 1993 and 1994 to 2002. For each period the flight statistics, fatal and non-fatalaccidents and their causes are given along with key indicators showing where major offshorehelicopter flight safety initiatives have been introduced. All helicopter types are included and an interpretation of the available information is set out in the following sections for consideration.\n3.5.2 The Years 1976 to 1984 \nTable 3.5 below shows the flight statistics for this period.\nFlight Hours Sectors Passengers Carried \nTotal Yearly\nAverageTotal Yearly\nAverageTotal Yearly\nAverage\n893,281 99,253 1,844,033 204,892 13,219,722 1,468,858\nTable 3.5    UKCS Offshore Helicopter Flight Statistics 1976 \u2013 1984 \nIt can be seen from the above table that an average of just over 200,000 sectors (flight stages)\nwas flown and a little under 1.5 million passengers were carried each year.\nTable 3.6 below shows the occupant fatal and non-fatal reportable accident rates for the period\n1976 to 1984. \nPer 100,000 Flying Hours Per 100,000 Sectors (Flight Stages) \nOccupant Fatal \nAccident Rate Non-Fatal Reportable\nAccident Rate Occupant Fatal \nAccident Rate Non-Fatal Reportable\nAccident Rate \n1.68 2.24 0.81 1.08\nTable 3.6    Fatal and Non-Fatal Reportable Accident Rates 1976 \u2013 1984 \n10Fatal Accident Rates recorded were 1.68 and 0.81 per 100,000 flying hours and sectors flown\n(flight stages) respectively.

Between 1976 and 2002 seven fatal accidents claimed the lives of 88 offshore workers and flight crew whilst travelling in offshorehelicopters.\nDuring the period 1976 - 1984 UKCS helicopter activity increased year on year in response to the \ndeveloping needs of the oil & gas industry. Toward the end of this period more modern helicopterswere introduced to replace some of the older types that had been involved in fatal accidents inearlier years. Ironically, 1985 \u2013 1993 was the period when the highest number of occupant\n15fatalities and reportable accidents were recorded on the UKCS but this was also the period when \nhelicopter activity on the North Sea was at its greatest.\nDuring the period 1994 to mid-2002 there were no fatalities on the UKCS. As a result, year on\nyear improvement in overall safety performance is evident from 1993 up to July 2002 when aSikorsky S76 fatal accident occurred in the Leman Field as a result of catastrophic main rotor blade failure.\nPer 100,000 Flying Hours Per 100,000 Sectors (Flight \nStages)\nPeriod Occupant Fatal\nAccident RateNon-Fatal\nReportable\nAccident RateOccupant\nFatal Accident \nRateNon-Fatal\nReportable\nAccident Rate\n1976 - 1984 1.68 2.24 0.81 1.08\n1985 - 1993 6.18 2.19 2.52 0.89\n1994 - 2002 1.34 0.98 0.61 0.44\n1976 - 2002 3.24 1.84 1.44 0.82\nTable 3.18    Fatal and Non-Fatal Reportable Accident Rates 1976 \u2013 2002 \nTable 3.18 above shows that for the first period 1976 -1984 and the third period 1994 to 2002 fatal\naccident rates are remarkably similar at 1.68 and 1.34 for flying hours and 0.81 and 0.61 for sectors flown respectively. This suggests there has been little change in safety performancebetween the early years of UK North Sea flying activity and the recent past. However, during thesecond period 1985 - 1993 there was a marked drop in safety performance with correspondingincreases in the fatal accident rates to 6.18 and 2.52 (flying hours and sectors flown respectively).The overall fatal accident rates for the past 27 years (for all helicopters) are also given in thistable.\nNon-fatal reportable accident rates for flying hours and sectors flown (flight stages) in the first\n(1976 - 1984) and second (1985 - 1993) periods are similar, but are more than halved in the thirdperiod (1994 - 2002). The reduction in the number of occurrences is approximately 64%.

COMPARISON WITH OTHER ACTIVITIES\n4.1 INTRODUCTION\nIn an effort to put the passenger risk associated with offshore helicopter transport into a more \nmeaningful context, the safety records of various forms of travel have been collated andcompared.  It should be noted that helicopter travel offshore is, in many respects, a uniqueoperation because flights are to remote installations and vessels, and much of the flight takesplace over water. Also, passengers are equipped with survival suits and other aids for theirjourney and undergo survival training.  Comparing activities that differ in environment and nature can be difficult and it is therefore worth noting that: \n\/g183\/g32 Fixed wing airline aeroplane operations are not truly comparable with public transporthelicopter operations because there are distinct differences between the operatingregimes for fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft. Helicopters conduct operations that fixedwing aircraft cannot.\n\/g183\/g32 Comparing offshore helicopter activities directly with onshore public transport helicopteractivities can be misleading because the types of operation, types and size of helicopter(and hence level of equipment fit), operating environment and passenger exposure are quite different.\n\/g183\/g32 Achieving accurate and meaningful comparisons between UK offshore helicopteroperations and similar activities around the world is not always straightforward. This isdue in part to the incompleteness of overseas data, the variable operating environmentsencountered (e.g. harsh vs. benign weather - UK operations are conducted in a harshweather environment), and differences in reporting criteria.\n\/g183\/g32 Unlike most other forms of transport, the size of the database for offshore helicopterpassenger transport operations is very small in statistical terms. This means that apparent patterns in the data could be the result of random chance rather than anysystematic cause. In addition, a single accident involving an offshore helicopter will have a proportionally more marked effect on the statistics than will a single accident involvinga transport type having a larger database.\nThe information in the following sections is included to assist readers reach their own conclusions.\n194.2 COMPARING UKCS WITH WORLD-WIDE OFFSHORE HELICOPTER\nOPERATIONS\nSome comparisons between UKCS and worldwide offshore helicopter operations safety\nperformance can be made using data available from the International Association of Oil & GasProducers (OGP).\nThe data available from OGP covers an 8-year period from 1995 to 2002. OGP\u2019s Aviation Sub-\nCommittee has been collecting worldwide oil industry helicopter data since 1994, but advise intheir reports that there are countries for which the accumulated operational data is incomplete,particularly in earlier years. OGP reporting is based on 100,000 flying hours and sectors (flightstages) and deals with occupant fatalities, which includes passengers and crew.\nIn this section it should be noted that Worldwide and All North Sea data is extracted directly from\ntables in OGP reports, whereas the UKCS data used for comparison is derived from the samesources used in Section 3. In OGP reports, figures quoted for Worldwide cover all global activitiesincluding All North Sea, which in turn includes UKCS activities.\nTable 4.1 overleaf gives the annual statistical data for fatal and reportable accident rates per\n100,000 flying hours and sectors for UKCS, All North Sea and Worldwide offshore operations from 1995 to 2002.\n20UKCS ALL NORTH SEA WORLDWIDE\nYear Fatal Acc.

The non-fatal accident ratevalue for Worldwide sectors flown is very slightly less than the UKCS, but both are only half therate for the All North Sea category.\n4.3 OTHER TRANSPORT MODES\nThe Transport Statistics Great Britain 2002, 27thEdition, published in October 2002 by the \nDepartment for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (DETR) provides data on yearlypassenger casualty rates by mode, for the period 1991 up to 2001. The rates published are based\non one billion (10\n9) passenger kilometres.\nFor the period 1992 to 2001, annual comparisons with DETR statistics (fatality rates) are set out in\nTable 4.3 overleaf along with values calculated for UKCS offshore helicopter operations. The data given for air travel relate to passenger casualties in accidents involving UK registered airlineaircraft in UK and foreign airspace. Comparing offshore helicopter operations with other forms of transport used in the UK helps to set it in the more meaningful context of everyday experience.\nTable 4.4 overleaf gives a summary of the 1992 to 2001 averages which indicate that, with the \nexception of rail, the safety record of offshore helicopter travel is much better than most forms ofland-based passenger transport and quite similar to that for travel by car.\n2002 has not been included in the comparison because DETR data for 2002 is not available at \nthis time. In addition, since 1994 when new EC reporting requirements were introduced, basedata are no longer collected for deriving offshore helicopter \"passenger kilometres\" values (alsoreferred to as seat-km). Therefore it will not be possible to accurately calculate a value for offshorehelicopters for 2002 (which includes the S76 fatal accident) and thus make reasonablecomparisons with other transport modes.\n22Transport Mode 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001\nOffshore Helicopter 43.3* 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nAir 0.07 0 0 0.05 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRail 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.2 0.4 0.5 0.4 0.9 0.4 0.1\nCar 4333333333\nTwo Wheeled Motor \nVehicle97 106 110 110 108 119 112 113 123 112\nPedal Cycle 43 46 43 52 50 45 40 42 31 33\nPedestrian 75 70 62 57 56 58 50 50 49 48\n* The North Cormorant fatal accident occurred offshore in 1992.\nNote: From 1994, EC regulations no longer require data on kilometres flown, passengers carried and passenger kilometres for off shore helicopters to be reported to the CAA.\nTable 4.3    Comparison of Passenger Fatality Rates per Billion Passenger Kilometres by Transport Mode (DETR Statistics for the Period 19 92 to 2001) \nTransport Mode 1992 - 2001 Average\nOffshore Helicopter 4.33\nAir 0.01\nRail 0.4\nCar 3\nTwo Wheeled Motor Vehicle 106\nPedal Cycle 42\nPedestrian 58\nTable 4.4    Comparison of Average Passenger Fatality Rates per Billion Passenger Kilometres by Transport Mode 1992 to 200 1\n235. CONCLUSIONS\nFrom 1976 up to year-end 2002, just over 48 million passengers have been transported to and \nfrom offshore installations on the UKCS and over 6 million sectors have been flown taking about 2.7 million flying hours. Between 1976 and 2002 seven fatal accidents claimed the lives of 88 offshore workers and flight crew whilst travelling aboard offshore helicopters. \nDuring the period 1976 - 1984 UKCS helicopter activity increased year on year in response to the \ndeveloping needs of the oil & gas industry. Toward the end of this period more modern helicopterstypes were introduced to replace some of the older types that had been involved in fatal accidentsin earlier years. Ironically, 1985 to 1993 was the period when the highest number of occupantfatalities and reportable accidents were recorded on the UKCS, but this was also the period whenhelicopter activity on the North Sea was at its greatest.\nFatal accident rates of 1.34 and 0.61 (flying hours and sectors flown respectively) recorded for the \nperiod 1994 to 2002 remain well below those recorded for the second period 1985 to 1993, butare similar to the first period 1976 to 1984. For the 10 years following the North Cormorant accident in 1992, no fatalities were recorded for UKCS offshore helicopter passenger transportoperations until July 2002 when the S76 fatal accident occurred in the Leman Field, the result of catastrophic main rotor blade failure.\nNon-fatal reportable accidents continue to occur on the UKCS, occasionally with serious injury\nbeing inflicted. However, it is recognised that the number of non-fatal reportable accidents hassignificantly reduced in recent years. A good measure of the level of improvement during the period 1994 to 2002 is the significant reduction in the rates of occurrences (both in terms of flyinghours and sectors) from the previous two periods. This appears to be largely due to the reductionin the number of technical failures since 1993. It is probable that part of this improvement can, atleast in part, be attributed to the introduction of Health Usage and Monitoring Systems (HUMS) onUK offshore helicopters from 1992. It should be noted, however, that the July 2002 fatal S76 accident was caused by a catastrophic component failure that would not have been identified byHUMS; detecting such failure modes is beyond current system capability.\nDirect comparisons of UKCS safety performance with Worldwide and All North Sea offshore\nhelicopter operations are limited to the 8 year period 1995 to 2002, and during which the UKCS fatal accident safety record compares favourably with the other regions. The non-fatal reportableaccident rates for flying hours for the UKCS are less than, but similar to, the All North Sea and Worldwide regions. Also, the non-fatal reportable accident rate for sectors is half that for the AllNorth Sea operations and very close to that for Worldwide operations.\nWhile the limitations of the exercise are recognised, in an effort to put the passenger risk\nassociated with offshore helicopter transport into a more meaningful context, the safety records ofvarious other forms of travel have been collated and compared. The data readily availablecovering the period 1992 to 2001 indicates that the averaged fatality rate per billion passenger kilometres for UK offshore helicopter transport is of a similar order to that of travel by car. NB: The\n242002 fatal S76 accident offshore has not been included in the comparison because DETR data for \n2002 was not available at the time of compilation.\nThis study and its analysis demonstrate that, overall, UKCS offshore helicopter operations have\nachieved a good safety record over the reporting period when compared with similar operationsglobally and with most other forms of UK land-based passenger transport. This is most clearlydemonstrated by offshore passenger transport helicopters recording zero fatalities for 9 yearsfrom 1993 to 2001. However, the fatal S76 accident that occurred in July 2002 serves to remindthe industry that there is no room for complacency.\nAdditionally, non-fatal reportable accidents continue to occur on the UKCS, occasionally with\nserious injuries being sustained as in the case of the Super Puma AS332 accident on the WestNavion helideck, in 2001. This situation highlights the need for the UK Oil & Gas industry tocontinue to vigorously pursue current and future safety initiatives and research projects to further reduce risks. A summary of safety initiatives is shown in Appendix 1. \n256.

They are not listed in any order of priority or importance.\n\/g183\/g32 Regular reviews and periodic updating of CAP 437, Offshore helicopter landing areas - guidance on standards:This key document is founded on the ICAO international standards and recommendedpractices, and provides the basic requirements applied to offshore helidecks by the regulators and helicopter operators to ensure they are fit for purpose.\n\/g183\/g32 Health and Usage Monitoring Systems (HUMS):HUMS was introduced on the UKCS in the early 1990's to reduce catastrophiccomponent failures by providing information on operating limit exceedences and earlydetection of defects. It has been highly successful and is now mandated by CAA for allUKCS Offshore helicopters. It should be noted that in respect of the recent fatal S76accident, which was caused by a catastrophic component failure (main rotor blade), the latent defect would not have been identified by HUMS because detecting such failuremodes is beyond current system capability.\n\/g183\/g32 Improved standard of helidecks and equipment:In the early 1990's a series of helideck surveys conducted by CAA on behalf of HSEidentified many helideck and equipment deficiencies and non-compliances withregulations and codes of practice. The outcome from these surveys led to introductionof the BHAB Helideck Inspection regime to provide for routine helideck examinationsand acceptance for flight operations by the helicopter operators.\n\/g183\/g32 Improved helideck operating standards:In response to helideck operating deficiencies, highlighted during the HSE \/ CAAoffshore helideck operations inspection programme, Guidelines for the Management of Offshore Helideck Operations were developed by Industry and other stakeholders and were first published by UKOOA in 1993. They are regularly reviewed and were lastupdated in 2003. \n\/g183\/g32 Offshore flights restricted in poor weather conditions:As a result of the findings of a fatal accident near Cormorant Alpha in 1992, industryintroduced operating policies to improve the management of helicopter operations inadverse weather conditions.\n\/g183\/g32 More competent helideck crews:\n27The training and competence of helideck crews was challenged in the early 1990's\nleading to industry and other stakeholders developing competence based trainingrequirements.\n\/g183\/g32 Greater focus on safe helidecks and helicopter operations: An offshore helideck is a collection of systems, some of which are safety critical.  DutyHolders have to identify such safety critical systems and have them independently verified as required by The Offshore Installations and Wells (Design and Construction,etc.) Regulations 1996 (SI 1996\/913). HSE Safety Notice 4\/99 - Offshore HelideckDesign and Operability was issued in September 1999 drawing attention to these requirements.\n\/g183\/g32 The introduction of Crew Resource Management (CRM): Helicopter operators, in conjunction with the CAA, have developed and introducedsystems to improve crew resource management. CRM training provides crews with skills for more efficient flight management. Progressively, since the late 1980's, multi-crewing and the use of all instrument rated pilots was introduced for UK offshore flights.\nSome of the above initiatives have been part of the extensive research into improving offshore\nhelicopter flight safety that has been ongoing since the Helicopter Airworthiness Review Panel(HARP) Report was published by the CAA in 1984 (CAP 491) and, subsequently, the Review ofHelicopter Offshore Safety and Survival (RHOSS) Report which was published in 1995 (CAP641). Other research projects that have already contributed to improving offshore helicopter flightsafety and those initiatives currently active, include:\n\/g183\/g32 Helideck motions on floating platforms and vessels:Since 1992 a significant amount of research has been carried out into the effects of themotion of helidecks on floating platforms and vessels on helicopters. The new motionseverity index (MSI) that has been developed will better establish whether a helicopter can safely remain on a moving helideck. Establishment of MSI-based helicopteroperating limits is nearing completion.\n\/g183\/g32 Environmental hazards around offshore platforms:According to pilot opinion (CAA Paper 97009 refers) turbulence represents the greatestsafety hazard and largest source of flight deck workload for crews landing on offshorehelidecks. A research project, funded jointly by the HSE and CAA and reported in CAAPaper 99004, investigated the nature and extent of environmental hazards around offshore helidecks, installations and vessels. Follow-on work to establish better aerodynamic criteria for validating helideck design is nearing completion.\n\/g183\/g32 Helideck lighting:On approach to an offshore helideck, the surrounding light pollution can hinder helidecklocation. Furthermore, existing helideck lighting systems can present a source of glarefor helicopter pilots and often do not provide adequate visual cues for landing. Trials of\n28a new helideck lighting system designed to address these issues have been successful\nand the new scheme is being introduced into the international standards and intoservice. The report on the first set of trials, performed at the NAM K14 platform, hasbeen published in CAA Paper 2004\/01. \n\/g183\/g32 Helicopter emergency flotation:This project is directed at practical improvements in the crashworthiness of flotationequipment to enhance post water impact survivability, and to provide a fall-back sidefloating attitude in the event of capsize following a ditching. Hydrodynamic model testsof potential systems have been carried out and are reported in CAA Paper 97010.Escape trials from a side floating \u2018helicopter\u2019 have been successfully performed using a helicopter underwater escape trainer (HUET) and are reported in CAA Paper 2001\/10. \n\/g183\/g32 Preparation of comprehensive Offshore Helideck Design Guidelines:Offshore helideck design guidelines have been developed in response to one of the recommendations in CAA paper 99004 (see above) which identified that some offshorehelideck and Installation operations can create problems that potentially affect flightsafety. Problems may be caused by helideck layout and equipment deficiencies,structure-induced turbulence, hot gas plumes generated by turbines and flares, or the effects of wave-induced motions on helidecks on floating structures and vessels. Theseaspects often result in operating limits being imposed by helicopter operators. TheGuidelines are scheduled for publication in early 2004. \n\/g183\/g32 Helicopter Operations Monitoring Programme (HOMP):Independent and continuous monitoring of flight operations allows helicopter operatorsto identify and address operational weaknesses (e.g. shortfalls in training orprocedures), and obtain better information on operational difficulties caused byenvironmental factors such as weather and t hereby minimise risks. HOMP trials were \nstarted in 2000 and were so successful that, in 2002, the industry committed to full-scale implementation. The original in-service trials of HOMP are reported in CAA Paper2002\/02.\n29"}
